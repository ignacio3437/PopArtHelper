------------------PopArtHelper------------------

PopArtHelper creates a new nexus file with the population metadata readable by PopArt.

Please copy and paste the program and example files to your machine before using.

Before you run:

-Complete a csv indicating the population of each sequence. The first row must have the columns "Sample" and "Pop". 

-Fill out a paramater.txt file. This file will indicate what files PopArtHelper will read. Just change the text to the left of the "##"

-Make sure the nexus,parameter, and csv file are in the same folder.

To run:

-MAC: Open terminal and drag the python program into the terminal and press enter.

-WINDOWS: Right click the program and open with python. If you dont have it installed you will need to do that first. 

-Enter the path of the parameter file. Remember you can just drag the parameter file into the window instead of typing it out!

Optional:

-To specify the order of the legend in PopArt, create a text file with each population on a new line in the desired order
and indicate this text file in the parameter file.

The output will be a new .nex file with a "_PopArt" suffix.
